# find-your-next-show

This repo is for a project I did while a Fellow at [Insight Data Science](http://www.insightdatascience.com).  The app was completed in three weeks from initial concept to full functionality.

## Overview

find-your-next-show is a data-driven, interactive web app for local live music discovery.  The finished product can be accessed at [findyournextshow](http://www.findyournextshow.com).  The motivation behind the project was the lack of tools available to explore touring artists and musicians near the end user in both space and time.

The UI is meant to encourage discovery by presenting the user with a graph whose nodes are artists and whose edges are the similarity between artists. The app is built around Python, MySQL, and d3.  The workflow for the app is given in the slides that can be found [here](http://www.findyournextshow.com/static/slides.pdf).
